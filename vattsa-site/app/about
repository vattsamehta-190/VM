      <p>
        I’m Vattsa Mehta, a management consultant and creator who loves building clear, useful things: decks that persuade,
        products that ship, and content that helps people level up. I live by my top values of Exploration, Iteration, and
        Connection. Exploration is what I do; I do it through iteration; and I do it to create more connection. Outside of work,
        I am prioritizing physical health, (re)building community, and cultivating creativity through interesting weekend projects.
